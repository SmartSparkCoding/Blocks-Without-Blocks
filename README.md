# Blocks-Without-Blocks
Ever felt that you use Quizlet and just want a better way to revise; or that you are terrible at the Blocks activity on Quizlet (welp, that’s me…), I created a way to play blocks, just… without the blocks game. 


## More Explaination

<strong>Blocks Without Blocks</strong> was originally based on a Quizlet app inside of revision called *Blocks*. Blocks was designed, as the classic game where you place blocks in a grid, normally 9x9, and once you get full vertical columns or horizontal rows, they get *blasted* into points. Blocks on Quizlet does the same, however, to gain some blocks to place on the grid, you must answer a revision question. Your aim is to not only be able to gain the most points from actually playing, but be able to get to the point of playing by answering revision questions. 

Personally, I find the blocks game, quite... annoying. This the mainly due to the fact of my lack of skill, but also it doesn't really help. So I thought, what if there was a way to play your Quizlets sets, just... without the Blocks game?

So I did! I present to you, Blocks without Blocks, featuring my favourite colour themeing! 

You can now export your quizlet sets, using commas to separate terms and definitions and a new line for each pair. An example:

term1,definition1
term2,definition2

Simply paste in your set, optionally save it in local save (a very handy feature, although it took long to code) and simply play! You recieve three hearts, one lost per question. You can gain hearts after getting five questions right. You can see how many questions you have answered in the bottom left corner. You also get points based on how many questions you answer. 

Furthermore, you can play this fully locally without any internet! This will also get you to retype the answer if you got it incorrect, to help you to consolidate your knowledge. 

Spelt something wrong? DON'T PANIC. The Blocks without Blocks system will allow a certain number of letter leniency to allow for slight typos or missing accents (if you are practicing a language). 

I have used this quite a lot, and personally, I find this EXTREMELY useful. Not that I am biased.... 

Enjoy my amazing app!
